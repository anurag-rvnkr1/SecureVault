# Secure-Vault
## 🔐 Password-Generator-And-Strength-Checker (Django Python)
Secure-Vault is an advanced Django-powered secure password generator and strength analyzer, designed for maximum security and usability. It ensures robust password creation with AI-driven entropy analysis and real-time strength evaluation, empowering users to generate, assess, and enhance their credentials effortlessly.

## 🚀 Features
- **Password Strength Analysis**:
  * Evaluates passwords based on length, complexity, entropy, and known vulnerabilities.
  * Provides real-time feedback on password security.
- **Secure Password Generator**:
  * Generates strong passwords with configurable length and character set (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).
  * Ensures compliance with best practices for password security.
- **Industry Standards Compliance**:
  * Incorporates NIST SP 800-63B password guidelines.
  * Checks against common password breaches (if integrated with APIs like Have I Been Pwned).
- **Intuitive Web Interface**:
  * User-friendly, responsive UI for seamless interaction.
  * REST API endpoints (if applicable) for integration with external applications.

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- **Entropy-Based Analysis**: Determines password strength using entropy calculations.
- **Blacklist Checks**: Prevents usage of commonly breached passwords (integrate with external APIs like HIBP).
- **Secure Password Storage**: If user authentication is implemented, follows best practices for hashing and salting passwords.
